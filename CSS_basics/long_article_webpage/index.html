      <mark>Artificial Intelligence</mark> (AI) has rapidly become a part of our daily lives. 
      From smartphones to cars, AI-driven systems are transforming how we work and interact with technology.
      This new wave of innovation brings both exciting opportunities and important challenges.
    </p>

    <p>
      The history of AI dates back to the 1950s, when computer scientists first began to explore 
      how machines could mimic human intelligence. Today, we see its influence in areas such as 
      <mark>healthcare</mark>, finance, and education. With each passing year, AI continues to evolve at an incredible pace.

      One of the most significant developments in AI is <mark>Machine Learning</mark>, 
      a process where systems learn from data to make predictions or decisions. 
      This technology powers applications like image recognition, recommendation engines, and speech translation.

      However, as AI grows, concerns about privacy, bias, and job automation also rise. 
      Many experts believe that we must establish clear <mark>ethical guidelines</mark> 
      to ensure that AI technologies are developed responsibly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Looking ahead, the future of AI seems both promising and uncertain. 
      It has the potential to solve global challenges, but it must be balanced with human values and oversight. 
      The journey of AI is just beginning — and it’s one of the most important stories of our time.
